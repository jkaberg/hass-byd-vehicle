# BYD Vehicle Integration for Home Assistant

## PLEASE READ FIRST!

This integration and the subsequent library is an alpha stage, especially the library needs work to map out all the available API states.

You have been warned.


## Description

The `byd_vehicle` integration connects Home Assistant to the BYD cloud service
using the [pyBYD](https://github.com/jkaberg/pyBYD) library. It provides
extensive vehicle telemetry, GPS tracking, climate control, door locks, seat
climate, and remote commands for BYD vehicles.

Requires `pybyd>=0.0.12`.

## Installation

This integration is not in the default HACS store. Install it as a custom
repository.

### HACS (Custom Repository)

1. Open HACS and go to **Integrations**.
2. Open the three-dot menu and select **Custom repositories**.
3. Add the repository URL and select **Integration** as the category.
4. Search for "BYD Vehicle" and install the integration.
5. Restart Home Assistant.
6. Add "BYD Vehicle" from **Settings > Devices & Services**.

### Manual

1. Open your Home Assistant configuration directory.
2. Create `custom_components/` if it does not exist.
3. Copy `custom_components/byd_vehicle/` from this repository into your
   configuration directory.
4. Restart Home Assistant.
5. Add "BYD Vehicle" from **Settings > Devices & Services**.

## Configuration

Configuration is done entirely through the Home Assistant UI (config flow).

Go to **Settings > Devices & Services > Integrations**, click **Add
Integration**, and search for **BYD Vehicle**.

### Setup fields

| Field | Type | Required | Default | Description |
|-------|------|----------|---------|-------------|
| Region | select | yes | Europe | API region endpoint (for example `Europe`, `Singapore/APAC`, `Australia`, `Brazil`, `Japan`, `Uzbekistan`, `Middle East/Africa`, `Mexico/Latin America`, `Indonesia`, `Turkey`, `Korea`, `India`, `Vietnam`, `Saudi Arabia`, `Oman`, `Kazakhstan`). |
| Username | string | yes | | BYD account username (email or phone). |
| Password | string | yes | | BYD account password. |
| Control PIN | string | no | | Optional 6-digit PIN required for remote commands (lock, climate, etc.). |
| Country | select | yes | Netherlands | Country used for API country code and language. |
| Polling interval | int | no | 300 | Vehicle data polling interval in seconds (allowed range: 30-900). |
| GPS polling interval | int | no | 300 | GPS location polling interval in seconds (allowed range: 30-900). |
| Smart GPS polling | bool | no | false | When enabled, uses different intervals depending on whether the vehicle is moving. |
| GPS active interval | int | no | 30 | GPS polling interval in seconds while the vehicle is moving (smart GPS, allowed range: 10-300). |
| GPS inactive interval | int | no | 600 | GPS polling interval in seconds while the vehicle is parked (smart GPS, allowed range: 60-3600). |
| Climate duration | int | no | 1 | Climate run duration in minutes for start-climate commands (allowed range: 1-60). |
| Debug dump API responses | bool | no | false | When enabled, writes redacted BYD API request/response traces to local JSON files for troubleshooting. |


## Notes

- This integration relies on the BYD cloud API and account permissions. Data
  availability and command support can vary by vehicle model and region.
- Unsupported command endpoints, cloud rate-limits, and control PIN lockouts are
  surfaced as explicit entity errors.
- When BYD reports a remote command endpoint as unsupported for a VIN, affected
  command entities become unavailable for that vehicle.
- The integration uses cloud polling (`cloud_polling` IoT class). Data freshness
  depends on the configured polling intervals.
- The `Last updated` sensor now reflects canonical telemetry freshness and only
  advances when core telemetry values change (realtime/charging/HVAC/energy
  material fields), not merely when transport timestamps churn.
- A dedicated `GPS last updated` diagnostic sensor exposes canonical GPS
  freshness side-by-side with telemetry freshness.
- Telemetry adaptive polling uses this same canonical telemetry freshness signal;
  GPS updates do not advance `Last updated`.
- Realtime and GPS fetches now use pyBYD cache-aware `stale_after` behavior,
  allowing scheduled coordinator polls to skip expensive trigger/poll API calls
  when MQTT/cache data is already fresh.
- A unique device fingerprint is generated per config entry to identify the
  integration to the BYD API.

### Debug dumps

When **Debug dump API responses** is enabled in integration options, BYD API
request/response traces are written to:

- `.storage/byd_vehicle_debug/`
- Home Assistant config path example: `/config/.storage/byd_vehicle_debug/`

Each trace is stored as a timestamped JSON file. This is intended only for
short-term troubleshooting because API payloads can contain sensitive metadata.

Behavior details:

- Disabled by default.
- Captures transport-level API request/response traces.
- Applies field redaction for common secrets before writing files.

### Debug logging (Home Assistant + pyBYD)

To enable verbose runtime logs from both this integration and the underlying
`pybyd` library, add this to your Home Assistant `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
logger:
  default: info
  logs:
    custom_components.byd_vehicle: debug
    pybyd: debug
```

Then restart Home Assistant (or reload YAML configuration for logger settings)
and reproduce the issue.

Where to view logs:

- **Settings → System → Logs** in Home Assistant UI
- `home-assistant.log` in your HA config directory

Tip: enable debug logging only while troubleshooting, as it can produce large
log volumes and may include sensitive vehicle metadata.
